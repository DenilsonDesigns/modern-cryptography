Kerckhoff's Principle:

    Encryption security should not be dependent upon the algorithm being secret.

    Obvious example is the Caesar's Cipher, if the the algo is known, super simple to crack.

Permutations:

    How many different ways can you order the elements?

    Formula: N! = N*(N-1)*...*2*1
