Kerckhoff's Principle:

    Encryption security should not be dependent upon the algorithm being secret.

    Obvious example is the Caesar's Cipher, if the the algo is known, super simple to crack.

Permutations:

    How many different ways can you order the elements?

    Formula: N! = N*(N-1)*...*2*1
    
Why is substition cipher not secure?

    88 bits security.

    DES (56 bits) - 1000$ HW, takes 15 days average to crack.

    from 56->88 bits, 15 * 2^32 > 100 million years.

Frequency analysis:
    
    Analyzing the letter frequency of an encrypted msg to compare the frequency of letters 
    and map those to the most commonly used English letters, i.e, the most commonly used
    letter in an encrypted msg would map to "e"

One Time Pad:

    Taking a message and reprensenting it as bits, using a random seed (in bits also)
