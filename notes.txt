Kerckhoff's Principle:

    Encryption security should not be dependent upon the algorithm being secret.

    Obvious example is the Caesar's Cipher, if the the algo is known, super simple to crack.

Permutations:

    How many different ways can you order the elements?

    Formula: N! = N*(N-1)*...*2*1
    
Why is substition cipher not secure?

    88 bits security.

    DES (56 bits) - 1000$ HW, takes 15 days average to crack.

    from 56->88 bits, 15 * 2^32 > 100 million years.
